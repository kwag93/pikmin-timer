  "description": "Analyze the pikmin-timer Next.js project at /Users/bh/kwagyoo/pikmin-timer and design a comprehensive architecture.\n\nContext: This is a Pikmin Bloom game mushroom respawn timer. Mushrooms respawn 5 minutes after completion. Users need to track up to 8 mushroom timers simultaneously.\n\nUser flow: If a mushroom has 3m30s left until completion, user inputs 8m30s (3m30s remaining + 5min respawn) and gets notified when timer reaches 0.\n\nAnalyze and provide:\n1. **Current code bugs**: The addTimer function hardcodes endTime to startTime + 5min instead of using user input. Identify all bugs.\n2. **Timer Architecture**: Design for 8 concurrent timers with independent countdowns. Each timer needs: id, label, startTime, endTime, remaining seconds, isRunning state.\n3. **Notification System**: Web Notification API for browser alerts when timer reaches 0. Include sound notification. Handle permission requests.\n4. **State Persistence**: localStorage strategy to survive page refreshes. Serialize/deserialize timer state.\n5. **Performance**: Analyze if 8 setInterval(1000ms) timers cause issues. Consider using a single requestAnimationFrame loop or single setInterval managing all timers.\n6. **Custom Hook Design**: Propose useTimer and useTimerManager hooks separating logic from UI.\n7. **Quick-add Feature**: Preset buttons like '+5min', '+8min', '+10min' for common mushroom scenarios.\n8. **Widget Architecture**: How to build a macOS menu bar widget version (Electron/Tauri considerations).\n\nRead the source files in app/page.tsx, components/TimerDisplay.tsx, components/TimerForm.tsx and provide concrete code architecture recommendations.",
