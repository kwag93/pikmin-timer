      "subject": "Codex task: Pikmin Mushroom Timer - Architecture & Logic Design",
      "description": "Analyze the pikmin-timer Next.js project at /Users/bh/kwagyoo/pikmin-timer and design a comprehensive architecture.\n\nContext: This is a Pikmin Bloom game mushroom respawn timer. Mushrooms respawn 5 minutes after completion. Users need to track up to 8 mushroom timers simultaneously.\n\nUser flow: If a mushroom has 3m30s left until completion, user inputs 8m30s (3m30s remaining + 5min respawn) and gets notified when timer reaches 0.\n\nAnalyze and provide:\n1. **Current code bugs**: The addTimer function hardcodes endTime to startTime + 5min instead of using user input. Identify all bugs.\n2. **Timer Architecture**: Design for 8 concurrent timers with independent countdowns. Each timer needs: id, label, startTime, endTime, remaining seconds, isRunning state.\n3. **Notification System**: Web Notification API for browser alerts when timer reaches 0. Include sound notification. Handle permission requests.\n4. **State Persistence**: localStorage strategy to survive page refreshes. Serialize/deserialize timer state.\n5. **Performance**: Analyze if 8 setInterval(1000ms) timers cause issues. Consider using a single requestAnimationFrame loop or single setInterval managing all timers.\n6. **Custom Hook Design**: Propose useTimer and useTimerManager hooks separating logic from UI.\n7. **Quick-add Feature**: Preset buttons like '+5min', '+8min', '+10min' for common mushroom scenarios.\n8. **Widget Architecture**: How to build a macOS menu bar widget version (Electron/Tauri considerations).\n\nRead the source files in app/page.tsx, components/TimerDisplay.tsx, components/TimerForm.tsx and provide concrete code architecture recommendations."

      "subject": "Gemini task: Pikmin Mushroom Timer - UI/UX Design for Web, Mobile & Widget",
      "description": "Design the UI/UX for a Pikmin Bloom mushroom respawn timer app. The project is at /Users/bh/kwagyoo/pikmin-timer (Next.js + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion + shadcn/ui).\n\nContext: Pikmin Bloom game - mushrooms respawn 5 minutes after completion. Users track up to 8 mushroom timers simultaneously. Each timer counts down and notifies when done.\n\nDesign requirements for THREE versions:\n\n**1. Web Desktop Version (primary)**\n- Clean, game-themed UI with Pikmin aesthetic (green nature theme, soft colors)\n- Grid layout for up to 8 timer cards (2x4 or responsive)\n- Each timer card shows: label, countdown (MM:SS), progress indicator, mushroom emoji/icon\n- Timer input form: minutes + seconds input with quick-add preset buttons (+5min, +8min, +10min)\n- Visual feedback: color changes as timer approaches 0 (green → yellow → red)\n- Animation: subtle Pikmin-themed animations (flowers, leaves)\n- Header with app title and total active timers count\n\n**2. Mobile Web Version**\n- Touch-optimized: large tap targets for timer buttons\n- Single column layout, swipeable timer cards\n- Bottom sheet for adding new timers\n- Compact timer display optimized for small screens\n- Consider PWA aspects (add to home screen)\n\n**3. macOS Widget Concept**\n- Minimal design: show active timers in compact list format\n- Small/Medium/Large widget sizes\n- Click to expand or open full web app\n- Menu bar icon showing nearest timer countdown\n\n**Design System:**\n- Color palette: Pikmin-inspired (nature greens, sky blues, mushroom browns/reds)\n- Typography: Clean, readable countdown numbers (monospace for timer digits)\n- Icons: Mushroom (🍄), Pikmin colors for timer identification\n- Spacing and layout using Tailwind CSS classes\n- Dark mode support\n\n**Interaction Design:**\n- Add timer: Quick preset buttons + custom time input\n- Remove timer: Swipe or X button with confirmation\n- Timer complete: Pulse animation + notification badge\n- Bulk actions: 'Clear all completed' button\n\nProvide detailed UI component structure with Tailwind CSS class suggestions and React component hierarchy. Read the existing code to understand current structure."
